This is a component for the open-source home automation platform, Home Assistant, that uses OpenAI's API to generate text in response to a service call.

Installation
Copy the openai directory to your Home Assistant custom_components directory.
Add the following to your Home Assistant configuration file:
yaml
Copy code
openai:
  api_key: YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
Restart Home Assistant.
Usage
The component sets up a service that can be called to generate text. To call the service, use the following in a script or automation:

yaml
Copy code
service: openai.openai
data:
  prompt: PROMPT_TEXT
  temp: TEMPERATURE
Where PROMPT_TEXT is the text prompt to give to OpenAI and TEMPERATURE is the temperature to use for the text generation (a value between 0 and 1).

The generated text will be set as the state of text.openai.

Credits
This component was created using the OpenAI API.
